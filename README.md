# odin-recipes

This is the first official project from bigswiftyy productions, sponsored by the Odin Project!

This project focuses on html (so far..). 

By the end, it will showcase:
 - html boilerplate creation
 - how to use comments
 - links and images, with alt text
 - lists, ordered and unordered
 - bold and italicized text, using <strong> and <em>
 - paragraphs and headings
 - and more!

This document will be revised post-completion of the project.
